If we want to have SSR with Astro + cloudflare pages and page function, see instructions here https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon/issues/35. I have tried and it works, the only problem is I want the sign up component to be in the footer this will cause every page to be SSR instead of static.

Since my need is very simple, so probably is separate work is easier and more elegant.
